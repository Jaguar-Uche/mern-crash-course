make changes in the vite.config.js file

THE MAIN THING IS THAT YOU VISIT LOCAL HOST 5000 FOR YOUR API AND LOCALHOST 5173 FOR REACT APP, SO YOU PUT IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU VISIT LOCALHOST 5000, YOU GET BOTH OF THEM 

PUT THOSE THINGS IN THE SERVER.JS AND RUN npm build in front end(which gives a dist folder)

BEFORE DEPLOYMENT, DELETE NODE_MODULES AND DIST FILE
(in the package.json set NODE_ENV = development in npm run dev and create a build and start file with NODE_ENV = production in the start file)

use express 4 so you can use the * without issues

create a git repo and make it public and initialize the folder as a git repo(git init) in the root directory
.gitignore for files

click the icon that looks like a spider
(the staged changes, click the + icon)
Add a commit message and commit

remember rafce snippet for giving code shortcuts
