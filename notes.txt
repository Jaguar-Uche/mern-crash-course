create vite@latest
npm install @chakra-ui/react@2.8.2 @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
npm i react-router-dom
npm i @chakra-ui/icons
npm i react-icons
npm i zustand 
make changes in the vite.config.js file

THE MAIN THING IS THAT YOU VISIT LOCAL HOST 5000 FOR YOUR API AND LOCALHOST 5173 FOR REACT APP, SO YOU PUT IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU VISIT LOCALHOST 5000, YOU GET BOTH OF THEM 

PUT THOSE THINGS IN THE SERVER.JS AND RUN npm build in front end(which gives a dist folder)

BEFORE DEPLOYMENT, DELETE NODE_MODULES AND DIST FILE
(in the package.json set NODE_ENV = development in npm run dev and create a build and start file with NODE_ENV = production in the start file)

use express 4 so you can use the * without issues

create a git repo and make it public and initialize the folder as a git repo(git init) in the root directory
.gitignore for files

click the icon that looks like a spider
(the staged changes, click the + icon)
Add a commit message and commit

go to github and copy the push existing repo from command line something and paste it into the command line

go to render.com
go to new 
click web service
go to git provider, install render for your repository, and then change the build command and start command

note difference between database name and collection name
then deploy web service
DONT FORGET TO DOWNLOAD THE VITE SOMETHING IN THE FRONT END SO IT DOESNT HANG IN RENDER (npm install -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react) IN FRONTEND

remember rafce snippet for giving code shortcuts
